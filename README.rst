Conventions
===========

*   The project top-level directory is also the source root.
*   We use PyTest for tests.
*   PyTest can be integrated with SetupTools (see
    https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html). We donâ€™t do this.
*   Common commands for builds, distributing, packaging, documentation etceteca
    are in :file:`Makefile`s.
*   RST-files and -docstrings are indented with 4 spaces.
*   Globals must be immutable.
